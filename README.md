## hello/introduction
> Name's Outlaw and or Tenko. I don't mind what you call me, but I prefer Outlaw more; and for Tenko -I prefer closer friends to call me by it.
>> He/Him pronouns strictly, If you do not know my pronouns at first please ask me.

>> Gmt+8 (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­)

*Before anything else important, I want to clarify that I am **not** a Nazi; For I am literally the opposite of that if you haven't seen my [Rentry](https://rentry.co/tacticalysmic). **I just like history is all, the concept of it and also because I like countryballs.***

*At first, yes -you may think that I am because of jokes i make around friends that allow me to/I am comfortable with, but that is just **my dark humor**. I do not condone my actions online in real life, nor do I do the things I state a fictional character does.*

## friendship note
> If you are thinking about interacting with me and wanting to be friends, here are some things to note (these are the reasons why I only have a few friends);
>> I have dark humor. I don't like when someone is too sensitive when a conversation/friendship escalates. You're the one who interacted with me, so you shouldn't be complaining (much).

>> I mostly don't show this type of humor, like at all. I only act like it when a friend that I'm comfortable with is with me and they let me do those jokes. Yet, its still something to be aware of. Since you may not want your friend to be deemed " problematic ".

>> I am a Communist (SHOCKER!). Is it too straight-forward? No, just being quick with it. Check my Rentry for an explanation on why (At the very bottom).

## DNI & Pony town info
DNI
> DNI list? Don't got one. Feel free to interact with me if you can handle my side personality -unless you're intentionally trying to be annoying and or obnoxious; then no, you aren't free to talk to me! But then again, you only live once so make of it what you will.

Pony town info
> Most of the time, I sit near the dandy's world fandom area at the right end of the market. There, I sit under a medium-sized tree. If you don't see me, then I might be hiding in one of the big trees next to the medium-sized one.

> I don't have c+h in my pony names, but you're always welcome to do so -unless I'm already sitting with someone that doesn't have c+h in their name.

> I sometimes have offline status on; if you see me on the map PLEASE don't whisper me/interact with me. Most of the time that means I'm already playing with someone else, and that's mostly when my dark humor comes into play. So if you aren't comfortable about me talking about that stuff near you because I'm with someone else and you weren't even suppose to be with me, don't interact with me.
